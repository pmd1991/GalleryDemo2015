# Photo Gallery Demo

## Introduction
This application is a photo gallery with a map of album locations.
When one of the map markers are clicked the photos for that album will
be displayed. When one of the album names is clicked the album will be
shown. Clicking on one of the pictures in an album displays an image
carousel.

To navigate back a breadcrumb is available.

There is a stream feature in the menu button that lists the pictures
by descending date.

## How to run
To run this application download all of the files and open the index.html file.
