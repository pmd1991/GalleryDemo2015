# Photo Gallery Demo

## Introduction
This application is an photo gallery with a map of album locations.
When one of the map markers is clicked the photos for that album will
be displayed. One can also click on the album names to display it. Clicking
on one of the pictures in an album displays an image carousel.

To navigate back a breadcrumb is available.

There is a stream feature in the menu button that lists the pictures
by descending date.

## How to run
To run this application download all of the files and open the index.html file.
